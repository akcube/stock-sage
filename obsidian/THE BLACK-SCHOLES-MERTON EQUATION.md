This single equation spawned multi-trillion dollar industries and transformed everyone's approach to risk.
$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2V}{\partial S^2}-rV = 0
$$
But to understand how we arrived here, we need to go back and understand what options are, and understand the evolution of this equation over time.
